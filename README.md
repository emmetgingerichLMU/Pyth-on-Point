# Pyth-on-Point

https://emmetgingerichlmu.github.io/Pyth-on-Point/

In the vibrant tech hub of Silicon Shores, a team of visionary programmers created Pyth-On Point, a language that redefined coding. Drawing inspiration from Python's simplicity, Pyth-On Point introduced groundbreaking features like AutoType Variables for intuitive type inference, One-Liner Functions for succinct code, Enhanced List Comprehensions for powerful data manipulation, Smart Loops for pattern-optimized iterations, and Implicit Error Handling for seamless debugging. This language quickly gained acclaim for making programming more accessible, efficient, and elegant. Pyth-On Point didn't just change how people wrote code; it transformed how they approached programming, fostering a community that valued clarity and innovation, thereby democratizing the world of software development.


# Python vs Pyth-on-Point:

Here's how they differ:

Pyth-On Point's Implicit Error Handling not only handles type conversions but also corrects logical errors in operations.

Pyth-On Point's Smart Loops can predict and generate complex sequences like prime numbers based on a specified pattern.

Pyth-On Point allows for One-Liner Functions to be defined in a natural language style, making code readable like everyday speech.



# Example code snippet:

# One liner Function Definitions
```
let name = "Ari"
define greet(name) then print "Hello " + name'

```

# List of static erors

Must use proper keywords, i.e. cannot define function without `define`, cannot declare variable without `let`
